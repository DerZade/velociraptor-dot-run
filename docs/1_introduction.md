# Introduction

Velociraptor is a script runner for Deno, inspired by npm's package.json scripts. It offers a similar experience but
with out-of-the-box support for declarative Deno CLI options, environment variables, concurrency and git hooks.

## Benefits

### Storing and sharing Deno CLI commands

As your project's Deno CLI commands become longer you'll probably want to write down some aliases to store them and
easily share them with your teammates.

### Sharing workflow scripts and git hooks

Share scripts to format, lint and test your code with your collaborators and easily link them to git hooks so they will
run automatically.

### Concurrently, built-in

Write concurrent scripts directly in your configuration files, no additional tools needed.

### Simplify GitHub Workflows

Use vr scripts directly in your CI Actions.
